done:

find tiling service, images, API, track info...

concept & layout

create icons, find info about cameras

turn rover images into clickable thingys
on click: pan and zoom to rover area

move camera icons to the right places, relative to rover pngs (move when window small)
make them clickable, on click filter for corresponding photos
add tooltip/pop-up for camera icons with further info (name + hyperlink..?)



_____________________
todo:

make simplified rover icons for tracks (small, maybe only outline)

click on MARS: zoom to overview
click on Spirit / Curiosity in title: zoom to corresponding site

add bigger Icon when the small ones disapper, maybe as a point close to the track, with name and icon
more transparency in rover/images view

more space (~1/3 of screen) for images, maybe make the small images bigger (would have to check whether that complicates view on small device..)

in rover-image-view: maybe clicking on the background could get you back to the map


make responsive, functional on small device

_____________________
additionally if time:

add timeline with simple slider icon
make its position change the style of the corresponding dot on the track to a small rover icon
