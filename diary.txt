__________________________________
mid-june until the final deadline:
__________________________________
turn rover images into clickable buttons, on click: pan and zoom to rover area (J)
make them move relative to the position of the track (J)

GM adaption of concept
no incorporation of a time slider but rather having the track act as that with sol-information on tooltip
get rid of image sidebar, replace by an overlay
the overlay shows the rover schema including the camea positions side-by-side with the image gallery
a second overlay opens when clicking on the pictures

move camera icons to the right places, relative to rover pngs (V)
make them clickable, on click: filter for corresponding photos (J)
add tooltip/pop-up for camera icons with further info (name) (J)
add sol-choosers since some points on the track include more than one sol (J)

further development of UI: navigation functions (V)
implementation of navigation functions (J)
click on MARS: zoom to overview
click on Spirit / Curiosity in title: zoom to corresponding site
more space (~1/3 of screen) for images

harmonize the styling (V)
make simplified rover icons for tracks (small, maybe only outline) (N)

add Earth data to the sol icon (JVN)

GM how to make responsive, functional on small device
- push gallery below rover svg
- sol-choosing buttons between rover svg and gallery
implementation of responsiveness (J)

clean the diary (V)

submit project (J)
_____________________________
possible further development:

add timeline with simple slider icon
make its position change the style of the corresponding dot on the track to a small rover icon
on click on pointer at full zoom (second click): go to rover-image view with all Sols to choose from
clicking on background in overlays to navigate back to initial site
