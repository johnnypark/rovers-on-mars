todo:

(N) make simplified rover icons for tracks (small, maybe only outline)

click on MARS: zoom to overview
click on Spirit / Curiosity in title: zoom to corresponding site

add bigger Icon when the small ones disapper, maybe as a point close to the track, with name and icon
more transparency in rover/images view

more space (~1/3 of screen) for images, maybe make the small images bigger (would have to check whether that complicates view on small device..)

in rover-image-view: maybe clicking on the background could get you back to the map

make responsive, functional on small device

harmonize the styling (V)

_____________________
additionally if time:

add timeline with simple slider icon
make its position change the style of the corresponding dot on the track to a small rover icon
