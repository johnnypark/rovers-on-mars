add bigger Icon when the small ones disapper, maybe as a point close to the track, with name and icon (J)
more transparency in rover/images view (J)

more space (~1/3 of screen) for images, maybe make the small images bigger (would have to check whether that complicates view on small device..) (J)

(N) make simplified rover icons for tracks (small, maybe only outline)

harmonize the styling (V)

add Earth data to the sol icon (JVN)

todo:



GM - in rover-image-view: maybe clicking on the background could get you back to the map
(hard to do)
other possibility: keep title active in overlay to navigate back - rejected 



_____________________

additionally if time:

add timeline with simple slider icon
make its position change the style of the corresponding dot on the track to a small rover icon
IDEA: on click on pointer at full zoom (second click): go to rover-image view with all Sols to choose from
